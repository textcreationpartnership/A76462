            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But the Mercie of God is above all his Works, and his Power extends it ≈øelf beyond the de≈øire of any humane expectation.</p>
            <p>For now in the depth of all Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, when they were ≈øo oppre≈ø≈øed with Famine: the mercifull God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed his power, and when they were in de≈øpair of all Succour or Relief, the Lord ≈øent comfort unto them.

            <p>No ≈øooner did the Enemy perceive their approach, but with all ≈øpeed they could they did provide to give them Battle, which was the de≈øire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the≈øe two Noble and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Cavaliers.</p>
            <p>The ≈øight of the≈øe approaching Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies gave great Comfort unto the de≈øpairing minds of the inclo≈øed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtants; who did now re≈øolve either for Liberty or Glorious Death, who immediatly provided them≈øelves to Repell the Enemy, and gain their own Freedome. They ≈øpeedily and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly betook them≈øelves to their Arms, and from the Town walls gave the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy ≈øuch a valley of ≈øhot, that many of them were on the ≈øudden cut off in their own ≈øecurity. At which unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ruine, they retreated a little way from the town, thinking to have retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the ≈øiege better provided, and have given them pre≈øent Battle.</p>

            <p>The day was half ≈øpent in this Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øh, and much blood was ≈øhed on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øide; but at the length, being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to conclude the battle with the Sun of the day, did pro≈øper the cau≈øe of the Prote≈øtants, and gave them ≈øo good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, that there were ≈ølain of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels 1700. or therabouts; be≈øides tho≈øe who were taken Pri≈øoners.</p>
            <p>There were taken by the Prote≈øtants of the Rebels in this Battle three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of e≈øpeciall note, who≈øe Names I thought fiit to ≈øet down for the ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
